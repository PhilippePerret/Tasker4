Tired of *to-do lists* as long as your arm that discourage you from working before you even start?…

Welcome to the "<: app_name :>" app, which lets you work with a zen mind, one task at a time.

After your [log in](/workers/log_in) or your [sign up](/workers/sign_up), you can choose what you want to do :


.center.inline:
  [Let’s work!](/work)
  |
  [Task list](/tasks) 
  |
  [Create a new task](/tasks/new)
